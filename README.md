# Training Rodents on Odor-cued Go-NoGo task
The task involves an odor-port and a water port. The water port delivers one of the four odors randomly at each trial initiated by the rodent inserting its nose into the odor port. Two of the odors are associated with Go behavior and the remainin two is with NoGo. In the Go trials, the moce receive a reward if they go to the water port as a correct response. In the No-Go trials animals, should avoid the water port for at least 2.5 seconds. 

Traning of the animals on this task consists of four phases. In Phase 1, animals learn that the water port delivers water as reward. In Phase 2, they learn that they need to insert their nose into the odor port for a brief amount of time to be able to get water from the water port. In Phase 3, we slowly increase the time, the animals had to stay in the odor port. And in Phase 4, we introduce the odors one by one as the animals learn the odors. Once they learn all the four odors, their training is completed.

The programs for controlling the hardware and task structure are written in Python and Arduino.
